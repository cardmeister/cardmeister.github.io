## The **single file** [element.card-t.js](https://github.com/card-ts/playingcardts/blob/master/element.card-t.js) is:

* W3C Custom Element: ``<card-t> </card-t>``

* SVG data for 52 playing cards - **500 KB** painstakingly slimmed

* Total **gzip** file size: **19 KB² creating 52 playingcardts:**

# Why another SVG playing card

I learned to [PEEK and POKE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEEK_and_POKE) at the age of 10 on a [TRS-80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80) and learned HTML (a bit late) at **25**  
The ability to 'peek at' and learn from someone else's effort was fantastic.  
In the past years 'Web Development' has become *For-Rocket-Scientists-Only*  

A 'Hello World!' with Framework **X** took hours installing tools and used  **95 KiloBytes** ... to display 12 characters.

Something did not feel right!

**What happened to the days when all you needed were some HTML tags and a text-editor?**

[W3C standard Custom Elements](https://www.dannymoerkerke.com/blog/web-components-will-replace-your-frontend-framework)¹ make writing semantic HTML as cool as it was in my early days .. **without any Framework!**  

Playingcard(t)s are a good subject to demonstrate the power of a Custom Element

* one single 19 KB² file creates a ``<card-t>`` element
* attributes for configuration
* 52 SVG playingcards
* **no** external SVG images

Feel free to PEEK around, and if you want to POKE submit an [issue](https://github.com/card-ts/playingcardts/issues/new).

A special thanks to users _Supersharp_ and _Intervalia_ for their always helpful answers on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/web-component+or+custom-element)!

¹ - Everyone uses the terms Custom Elements & Web Components interchangeably.

² - 19 KB GZipped
    And since it is card-game .. I cheated a bit ... but can you spot where?

# How the ``<card-t>`` Custom-Element works

For an introduction to W3C standard Custom Elements/WebComponents [read the excellent Blog by Danny Moerkerke](https://www.dannymoerkerke.com/blog/web-components-will-replace-your-frontend-framework)

Like the HTML5 ``<video>`` tag, the Custom Element ``<card-t>`` abstracts complex functionality into one HTML tag

💡 Custom Elements must be declared in a [Namespace](https://www.webcomponents.org/community/articles/how-should-i-name-my-element), so require a - hyphen in the tag name 

## Minimal HTML file to display a Queen of Hearts:

```html
  <html>
    <head>
        <script src='element.card-t.js'></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <card-t rank=Queen suit=Hearts></card-t>
    </body>
  </html>
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/mfhk2pd.jpg)

**Custom Element ``<card-t>`` creates an image with the SVG as ``data:image`` src**

Saves you from headaches with SVG in a document (duplicate symbol ids, bleeding CSS etc.)  
and makes it easy to add HTML Drag-Drop functionality.

### How it looks in F12 Developer Tools:

![](https://i.imgur.com/7csZylT.jpg)

💡 Drag a card image to your desktop to see the created SVG 

Since ``<card-t>`` only creates a single IMG **no shadow-DOM is used**, thus IMG can be styled with **global CSS**.

```css
    [rank="queen"] img {
       border: 3px solid greenyellow;
       transform: rotate(15deg);
    }
```

# My next challenge: a Solitaire game in Custom Elements

```html
  <cardts-game>
    <cardts-deck type="frenchdeck"></cardts-deck>
    <cardts-pile>
      <% 7 times %>
        <cardts-pile type="sequence"></cardts-pile>
      <%%>
    </cardts-pile>
    <cardts-pile id="foundation" type="stack">
      <% 4 times %>
        <cardts-pile></cardts-pile>
      <%%>
    </cardts-pile>
  <cardts-game>
```

## or even weirder ``<card-t>`` games ...

What if cardts could:

* change suit during a game
* fade out during a game
* change from Queens to Kings
* ...
* ...

# ``<card-t>`` attribute syntax

**playingcardts Terminology:**

* 'court' is UK English for 'face' US English. So Jack, Queen and King are **court**-cards (courts)
* SHDC is short for Spades-Hearts-Diamonds-Clubs 
* 0123 are Array indexes 

**``<card-t>`` takes a sh*tload of attributes you can play with:**

* ``letters`` - Custom localized court letters 
* ``courts`` - mix rank/courts images
* ``suits`` - Mix suit/court images
* ``suitcolor`` - Change SHDC suit color
* ``cardcolor`` - card color
* ``opacity`` - set card content opacity
* ``courtcolors`` - Change court image colors
* ``bordercolor`` - set card border color
* ``borderradius`` - set card border radius
* ``borderline`` - set card border line thickness

# 🔧 ``letters`` - Custom localized court letters 

default: AJQK 

Rename Ace, Jack, Queen, King letters AJQK to Dutch locale 'Aas Boer Vrouw Heer'

````HTML
    <card-t suit=Spades   rank=Ace   letters=ABVH></card-t>
    <card-t suit=Hearts   rank=Jack  letters=ABVH></card-t>
    <card-t suit=Diamonds rank=Queen letters=ABVH></card-t>
    <card-t suit=Clubs    rank=King  letters=ABVH></card-t>
````

![](https://i.imgur.com/y83wjG8.jpg)

💡 a 4 letter string is used so it can be a global setting for all created cards

💡 Custom ``letters`` draw **all** ranks (A,2,3,4 etc.) in Arial font

💡 ``letters`` can **not** be Emoji (Unicode strings)

# 🔧 ``courts`` - mix rank/courts images

default: 012

Before anyone complains the Queen is always #2

Rearrange SHDC court images to KJQ:

````html
    <card-t suit=Hearts   rank=Jack  courts=201></card-t>
    <card-t suit=Spades   rank=Queen courts=201></card-t>
    <card-t suit=Diamonds rank=King  courts=201></card-t>
````

![](https://i.imgur.com/sw8hWDi.jpg)


# 🔧 ``backcolor`` - card backside color

default: #E55 (red)

````html
    <card-t rank=0 backcolor="red"  ></card-t>
    <card-t rank=0 backcolor="green"></card-t>
    <card-t rank=0 backcolor="#44F" backtext="COPYRIGHT" backtextcolor=black></card-t>
````

![](https://i.imgur.com/GxT3m91.jpg)

# 🔧 ``suitcolor`` - Change SHDC suit color

default: #000,red,red,#000

# 🔧 ``cardcolor`` - card color

default: #FFF

````html
    <card-t rank=1 suit=0 suitcolor="#FFF,#FFF,#FFF,red"   cardcolor="red"       ></card-t>
    <card-t rank=1 suit=1 suitcolor="#FFF,yellow,#FFF,red" cardcolor="green"     ></card-t>
    <card-t rank=1 suit=2 suitcolor="#FFF,#FFF,black,red"  cardcolor="dodgerblue"></card-t>
    <card-t rank=1 suit=3 suitcolor="#FFF,#FFF,#FFF,red"   cardcolor="yellow"    ></card-t>
````

💡 You need to specify all 4 colors even when only applying one suit (allows for a global setting)

Since the string is converted to an array the above can be written as:

````html
    <card-t rank=1 suit=0 suitcolor="#FFF,"    cardcolor="red"       ></card-t>
    <card-t rank=1 suit=1 suitcolor=",yellow," cardcolor="green"     ></card-t>
    <card-t rank=1 suit=2 suitcolor=",,black," cardcolor="dodgerblue"></card-t>
    <card-t rank=1 suit=3 suitcolor=",,,red"   cardcolor="yellow"    ></card-t>
````

💡 non-color values will break the SVG suit display

💡 add attribute ``norank=true`` and only the big center suit remains

![](https://i.imgur.com/uvGJKQX.jpg)

# 🔧 ``opacity`` - set card content opacity

default: 0.8 

💡 0.8 makes the cards look not too sharp, and you can highlight card-ts by setting opacity to 1

````html
    <card-t rank=1 suit=0 opacity=1  ></card-t>
    <card-t rank=1 suit=1 opacity=.75></card-t>
    <card-t rank=1 suit=2 opacity=.5 ></card-t>
    <card-t rank=1 suit=3 opacity=.1 ></card-t>
````

💡 CSS opacity makes the whole IMG transparent!  ``<card-t opacity=n>`` leaves the ``<card-t>`` **backcolor** at 100%

![](https://i.imgur.com/eZhAuob.jpg)

# 🔧 ``bordercolor`` - set card border color

default: #444 (darkgray)

# 🔧 ``borderradius`` - set card border radius

default: 12

# 🔧 ``borderline`` - set card border line thickness

default: 1

````html
    <card-t rank=1  suit=0 bordercolor=red     borderradius=12   borderline=12></card-t>
    <card-t rank=4  suit=0 bordercolor=hotpink borderradius=100% borderline=20></card-t>
    <card-t rank=13 suit=H bordercolor=gold    borderradius=12   borderline=38></card-t>
````

![](https://i.imgur.com/pdbp75j.jpg)

# ☠️ ``courtcolors`` - Change court image colors

<b style=color:lightcoral>this setting will most likely be gone in 'less SVG' version 2</b>

default: #DB3,red,#44F,#000,#000,4  (gold,red,blue,black,blacklines,linethickness)

````html
    <card-t suit=Hearts   rank=Jack  courtcolors=gold,red,blue,black,black,4               ></card-t>
    <card-t suit=Spades   rank=Queen courtcolors=#DB3,lightcoral,lightblue,slategray,#000,1></card-t>
    <card-t suit=Diamonds rank=King  courtcolors=gold,red,green,orange,#000,4              ></card-t>
````

💡 suit decorations are set by the ``suitcolor`` attribute

# How I reduced 500 KB SVG 

All good open-source SVG playingcards available are high-precision ready for print. 

In the [HTML5 deck of cards](https://deck-of-cards.js.org/) the [King of Hearts](https://deck-of-cards.js.org/faces/1_13.svg) **alone is 69 KB**!!  ``<card-t>`` creates 52 cards in **19 KB**!

* I started with the 550 KB for 52 CC-0 licensed cards from the [card generator by Adrian Kennard](https://www.me.uk/cards/)
* reduced precision with: [Jake Archibalds GUI for SVGO](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/)  
(this causes some alignment 'errors' you only see viewing a court card full screen)
* spent some time in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) reducing details you don't see on a computer screen
* cut everything up in separate SVG paths
* made redundant paths into single JS functions
* cleaned up some courts which (since ages) had the suit on the wrong? side
* wrote a ``SVGcardt()`` function to create an IMG with SVG data
* and then I cheated...

![](https://i.imgur.com/9euOd0r.jpg)

### A note on data compression

The SVG can be reduced more using a [LZMA compressor](http://lzma-js.github.io/LZMA-JS/demos/advanced_demo.html) 
But HTTP requires Base64 encoding.  
And the Browser needs to decompress the data which takes a hefty 200ms (and a 6.9KB decoder)

Version 0 did LZMA de-compression and lazy loaded all 12 court images.

Since gzip is a similar compression (over the whole file)  
there is only a gain on slow 3G connections (download takes 3.1 seconds instead of 3.3 seconds)

# Frequently Asked Questions

### 🃏 Why ``<card-t>``

A Custom Element requires its own [Namespace](https://www.webcomponents.org/community/articles/how-should-i-name-my-element), so you are stuck to something with a - hyphen.

You can create 52 Custom Elements (extended from ``<card-t>``):

````html
  <queen-of-hearts></queen-of-hearts>
  <ten-of-spades></ten-of-spades>
  ...
````

But there is little value as you can not use **partial** Selectors for tag names.  
To select all Spades you still need attributes:

````html
  <queen-of-hearts hearts></queen-of-hearts>
  <ten-of-spades spades></ten-of-spades>
  ...
````

### 🃏 How about separating Element and SVG data?

Yes, an option is to exclude the (compressed/raw) SVG data from the Element file.  
The Element can then fetch the data asynchronous.

This project was about stuffing everything into **one** file.

### 🃏 Where is the NPM installer?  

If you need an installer to copy **one** file: [element.card-t.js](https://github.com/card-ts/playingcardts/blob/master/element.card-t.js)  
You might find a better career flipping burgers at McDonalds.

### 🃏 Where is the ``SVGcardt()`` source?

The ``<card-t>`` Custom Element declaration in [element.card-t.js](https://github.com/card-ts/playingcardts/blob/master/element.card-t.js) is Open Source.  
You can rename ``<card-t>`` to anything you want and customize the Custom Element to your liking.

The SVG creation code took some blood, sweat and tears and is closed source for now. 

**You do NOT need the ``SVGcardt()`` _Source Code_ to use ``<card-t>`` in applications**

### 🃏 Are cardts really created in the browser/not downloaded?

See F12 Network tab, ``data:image/svg`` cardts take **0 milliseconds** download time 

![](https://i.imgur.com/ieN7gvc.jpg)

### 🃏 Where is the Joker?

😉 Causing havoc in Gotham City?!

I haven't found a good Joker Card design yet, if you have one let me know

# 🃏 Where did you cheat?

Look closely at the court cards.... 

# 🔧 ``suits`` - Mix suit/court images

default: 1111

Change Spades=0, Hearts=1, Diamonds=2, Clubs=3 court image:

````HTML
    <card-t suit=S rank=Queen suits=1111></card-t>
    <card-t suit=H rank=Queen suits=1111></card-t>
    <card-t suit=D rank=Queen suits=1111></card-t>
    <card-t suit=C rank=Queen suits=1111></card-t>
````

Uses Hearts court images for all 4 suits

**Who noticed me cheating?**

In the 19 KB version all Jacks, Queens and Kings courts use the same (Hearts) court SVG image with slightly different colors.
